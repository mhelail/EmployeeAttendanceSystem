\# Employee Attendance \& Activity Logging System



I built this as a Windows Forms application to keep track of employees, when they come and leave work, and a short note about what they did during the day. The data is stored in a MySQL database.



\## What the app does



\- Add, edit and delete employee records  

\- Record daily attendance (entry and exit time)  

\- Add a short activity / note for each employee  

\- List and search employees and their attendance records  



\## Technologies



\- C#

\- .NET / Windows Forms

\- MySQL
